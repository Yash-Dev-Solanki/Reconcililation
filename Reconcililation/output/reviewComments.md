The report generated by the anomaly detector was not validated & needs expert review.
Account 1619205 is incorrectly classified as an anomaly due to the non-uniform decrease not being aligned with the historical trend; the report fails to recognize that the reduction is consistent with previous breaks. Account 1619288 correctly identifies the break as not an anomaly due to preceding uniform increases. Account 1618001 noted a break but should not be classified as an anomaly as it requires more analysis before making such a determination. Account 1619215 accurately reflects no anomaly due to consistent breaks.
